# For keeping track of what we do every week


## Meeting #4 - Oct. 27th

### Thoughts : 
- **Facebook AI wrote a [paper](https://ai.facebook.com/blog/deep-learning-to-translate-between-programming-languages/)** on a code translator they created ([repo](https://github.com/facebookresearch/TransCoder)). To get their data, they [used GitHub and Google Big Query](https://github.com/facebookresearch/CodeGen/blob/main/docs/googlebigquery.md).  
In the visual representation showed in the paper, if things are "semantically similar", they are grouped close together.  
We can download and use their model since it is open-source.
 
 ### Tasks:
 1) Get ourselves the actual data (repositories)
 2) Re-use the pygments prototype to extract the data
 3) Download the actual Facebook model
 4) We will then be able to use
